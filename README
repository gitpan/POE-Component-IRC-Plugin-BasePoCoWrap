POE-Component-IRC-Plugin-BasePoCoWrap

The module is a base class to use for plugins which use a
POE::Component::* object internally.
It provides: triggering with a trigger, listening for requests in
public channels, /notice and /msg (with ability to configure which exactly)
as well as auto-responding to those requests.
It provides "banned" feature which allows you to ignore certain people
if their usermask matches a regex.

I am not sure how flexible this base wrapper can get, just give it a try.
Suggestions for improvements/whishlists are more than welcome.
